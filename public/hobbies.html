    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>When I'm not working, I can be found pursuing many other passions.</p>
    <p><strong>Parenting: </strong> I've got a kid and it's the best and hardest job in the world. They're way more creative and artistically talented than I was at their age. Doing things with them brings me such joy. </p>
    <p><strong>Creative activities: </strong>It shouldn't come as any surprise that a former art teacher likes to draw and do other crafty and artistic things. I also like to play guitar.</p>
    <p><strong>Gardening: </strong>My wife is more the planner, picking out various native plants for our house. I'm more like the hired labor, but it is something I enjoy. It gives me a chance to be outside, measure time by the seasons and as someone recently told me: "It's an optimistic pursuit."</p>
    <p><strong>Sports: </strong>Baseball is my personal favorite, though I'm also a big football fan. I root for my local teams, the Phillies and the Eagles. The mainstream sports are fun, though I also love the drama and narrative of sports, which I can find in many other sports. I used to be way more into cycling and I've been getting more into soccer as I get older.</p>
